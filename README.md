# 🎵 Music Player Project 🎵

Welcome to my Music Player project!
This project is an exciting journey into building a fully functional music player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

I started this project with a template that provided some basic CSS for the appearance.
From there, I expanded the project significantly by adding more HTML for structure, additional CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

## ✨ Purpose

The main goal of this project was to learn and understand how to build a music player using JavaScript.

This involved:

- Manipulating user interactions
- Implementing animations
- Understanding DOM manipulation

## 🔍 Features

- **Array of Objects**: The music player uses an array of objects to store properties for each song locally.
- **Event Listeners**: Functions and event listeners are used to handle user interactions and animate elements.
- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: The project showcases how to dynamically manipulate the DOM to create a smooth and interactive user experience.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript, especially in handling arrays and objects.
- **Event Handling**: Improved skills in setting up and managing event listeners.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Enhanced ability to manipulate the DOM to create responsive and interactive web applications.
- **CSS Animations**: Applied CSS animations to improve the visual appeal and user experience of the music player.
